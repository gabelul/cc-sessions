# Project Orchestration Enhancement Plan

**Document Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-01-29
**Status**: Planning Phase
**Priority**: High Impact - Transforms cc-sessions from task tool to project tool

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive enhancement to cc-sessions that addresses the critical gap in project-level workflow management. While cc-sessions excels at individual task management with DAIC enforcement, it lacks automated orchestration for multi-step projects.

### Core Problem:
Users must manually manage context switching between related tasks, leading to:
- **Context pollution** between project steps
- **Manual orchestration** of task transitions
- **Lost project state** across session restarts
- **Fragmented workflow** that breaks project continuity

### Proposed Solution:
Intelligent project orchestration with automatic context management, Memory Bank persistence, and seamless task transitions.

## Current State Analysis

### What `/project` Command Currently Provides ✅

Based on analysis of `cc_sessions/commands/project.py`:

**Core Capabilities**:
- `/project create <name>` - Initialize new project with step breakdown
- `/project work <name> <step>` - Start working on specific step
- `/project complete <name> <step>` - Mark step as completed
- `/project status <name>` - Show project progress and completion percentage
- `/project parse <name>` - Re-parse plan files for changes

**Technical Features**:
- **Git branch integration** - Auto-creates `project/name/step-x-y` branches
- **Step tracking** - Completion percentages, validation criteria
- **CC-sessions integration** - Updates `current_task.json` for context
- **State persistence** - JSON files in `sessions/projects/`

**Project Structure**:
```
sessions/projects/
├── my-project/
│   ├── state.json          # Project status, completion tracking
│   └── plan.md             # Step breakdown with implementation details
```

### Critical Gaps Identified 🔴

#### 1. **No Automatic Context Management**
```
Current Workflow:
1. /project work my-api 1.1     → Loads step context
2. [Work on step, context grows]
3. /project complete my-api 1.1 → Marks complete
4. /project work my-api 1.2     → Loads next step
5. [Context still contains step 1.1 details] ❌ POLLUTION

Needed Workflow:
1. /project work my-api 1.1     → Loads step context
2. [Work on step, context grows]
3. /project complete my-api 1.1 → Marks complete
                                → Saves step context to Memory Bank
                                → Suggests context restart
4. [User restarts session]      → Auto-loads project state
5. /project work my-api 1.2     → Fresh context for step 1.2 ✅
```

#### 2. **Manual Task Transitions**
```
Current: User must manually:
- Remember which step is next
- Clear context when it gets polluted
- Load context for next step
- Track dependencies between steps

Needed: Automatic flow:
- /project next → Complete current + load next
- Smart suggestions for optimal next step
- Dependency checking before step start
- Automatic context management
```

#### 3. **No Cross-Session Project Continuity**
```
Current: After session restart:
- User has to remember which project they were on
- No automatic loading of project state
- Must manually navigate back to current step

Needed: Session continuity:
- Auto-detect active project on session start
- Restore project context automatically
- Show progress and suggest next actions
```

#### 4. **Limited Project Creation Support**
```
Current: User manually creates plan.md with steps

Needed: AI-assisted project creation:
- "Build a REST API" → Auto-generates logical steps
- Template-based project initialization
- Dependency analysis and step ordering
```

## Problem Statement

### The Context Pollution Challenge

**Root Issue**: Claude Code sessions accumulate context as work progresses. For single tasks, this is beneficial. For multi-step projects, it becomes problematic:

1. **Step 1**: Database schema design (1000 tokens of context)
2. **Step 2**: API endpoints design (2000 tokens of context + 1000 from Step 1)
3. **Step 3**: Frontend components (3000 tokens + 3000 from previous steps)
4. **Result**: By step 5, Claude is carrying irrelevant context from all previous steps

### The Manual Orchestration Burden

**Current Reality**: Users become project managers instead of developers:
- Tracking which step comes next
- Deciding when to clear context
- Managing state across session restarts
- Coordinating between related tasks

**Desired Reality**: cc-sessions handles orchestration automatically:
- Clear progression through project steps
- Automatic context management
- Persistent project state
- Smart suggestions for next actions

### The Session Continuity Gap

**Problem**: Multi-session projects lose continuity:
- No memory of project progress after restart
- Must manually return to correct step
- Context from previous sessions is lost
- No project-level insights persist

**Solution**: Memory Bank integration for persistence:
- Project state survives session restarts
- Context from completed steps remains accessible
- Progress tracking across multiple sessions
- Project insights accumulate over time

## Proposed Solution Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **Intelligent Step Transitions**
```python
# Enhanced project completion flow
def complete_step_with_orchestration(project_name, step):
    # Mark step complete
    mark_step_complete(project_name, step)

    # Save step context to Memory Bank
    save_step_context_to_memory_bank(project_name, step, current_context)

    # Analyze next optimal step
    next_step = analyze_next_step(project_name)

    # Check context size and suggest restart if needed
    if context_size > threshold:
        suggest_context_restart(project_name, next_step)
    else:
        offer_continue_to_next_step(project_name, next_step)
```

#### 2. **Memory Bank Project Persistence**
```json
// Memory Bank project structure
{
  "project": "my-api",
  "current_step": "1.2",
  "status": "active",
  "completion_percentage": 40,
  "steps": {
    "1.1": {
      "status": "completed",
      "context_summary": "Designed user and post tables with relationships",
      "implementation_notes": "Used PostgreSQL with UUID primary keys",
      "validation_completed": ["Schema created", "Migrations tested"]
    },
    "1.2": {
      "status": "in-progress",
      "context_summary": "Building REST endpoints for user management",
      "dependencies": ["1.1"]
    }
  },
  "project_insights": [
    "Using Express.js with TypeScript",
    "Authentication via JWT tokens",
    "PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM"
  ]
}
```

#### 3. **Context Management Engine**
```python
class ProjectContextManager:
    def __init__(self, project_name):
        self.project_name = project_name
        self.memory_bank = MemoryBankClient()

    def save_step_context(self, step, context):
        """Save current step context to Memory Bank"""
        summary = self.summarize_step_work(context)
        insights = self.extract_insights(context)

        self.memory_bank.save({
            "project": self.project_name,
            "step": step,
            "summary": summary,
            "insights": insights,
            "timestamp": datetime.now()
        })

    def load_project_context(self):
        """Load relevant project context for current session"""
        project_data = self.memory_bank.get_project(self.project_name)
        relevant_context = self.build_relevant_context(project_data)
        return relevant_context

    def suggest_context_restart(self, next_step):
        """Suggest session restart with guidance"""
        print(f"""
        ✅ Step completed and saved to Memory Bank

        💡 Context is getting large. For optimal performance:
        1. Restart this session (Cmd+Shift+L)
        2. I'll automatically load project context
        3. Ready to work on step {next_step}

        Say 'restart' when ready, or 'continue' to keep going.
        """)
```

#### 4. **Session Startup Integration**
```python
# Enhanced session-start.py
def check_for_active_project():
    """Check if user has an active project and restore context"""
    current_task = load_current_task()

    if current_task.get('task', '').startswith('project:'):
        project_name = current_task['project']['project']
        current_step = current_task['project']['step']

        # Load project context from Memory Bank
        project_context = load_project_context_from_memory_bank(project_name)

        print(f"""
        📋 Continuing project: {project_name}
        🔨 Current step: {current_step}
        📊 Progress: {project_context['completion_percentage']}%

        Project Summary:
        {project_context['summary']}

        Ready to continue? Say 'continue' or '/project status {project_name}'
        """)
```
