# cc-sessions User Experience Improvements Plan

**Document Version**: 1.0
**Date**: 2025-01-29
**Status**: Planning Phase

## Executive Summary

This document outlines specific improvements to enhance cc-sessions user experience while preserving its core value proposition: preventing Claude from going off-rails through DAIC (Discussion-Alignment-Implementation-Check) enforcement.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Simplify onboarding** - Reduce installation friction with quick defaults
2. **Improve discoverability** - Help users find powerful features (agents, commands)
3. **Enhance first-time experience** - Guide users through the workflow naturally
4. **Maintain core principles** - Preserve DAIC blocking and branch enforcement

## Current State Assessment

### What cc-sessions Does Well ✅

**Core Workflow Enforcement**:
- DAIC blocking prevents Claude from immediate over-implementation
- Branch enforcement prevents wrong-branch commits
- Task context preservation maintains focus across sessions
- Specialized agents handle heavy operations in separate contexts

**Robust Architecture**:
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Hook system for behavioral enforcement
- Memory Bank MCP integration for persistence
- Comprehensive configuration system

**Advanced Features**:
- Build project management for multi-phase work
- Document governance with PRD/FSD validation
- Automatic version bumping system
- Context retention and compaction

### What Works in Current Installation ✅

- Custom trigger phrase addition during setup
- Memory Bank MCP auto-detection and setup
- File synchronization discovery and configuration
- Statusline installation option
- Settings preservation during updates

## Pain Points Analysis

### 1. **Installation Overwhelm** 🔴
**Problem**: Too many configuration questions upfront
- 10+ prompts during installation
- Users don't know what options mean
- No "just get started" path

**Evidence**: Users want to try cc-sessions quickly, not configure extensively

### 2. **Poor First-Time Experience** 🔴
**Problem**: After installation, users don't know what to do
- Generic "create a task" instruction
- No hands-on experience with workflow
- Hidden features remain undiscovered

**Evidence**: Users don't realize agents, commands, or Memory Bank features exist

### 3. **Feature Discoverability** 🟡
**Problem**: Powerful features are invisible to users
- Agents (context-gathering, code-review, logging, etc.)
- Commands (/build-project, /sync-*, etc.)
- Memory Bank integration capabilities
- Advanced workflow options

### 4. **Mode Feedback Clarity** 🟡
**Problem**: Users don't understand current state
- Unclear when in Discussion vs Implementation mode
- No obvious way to check current task/branch
- Trigger phrases not easily discoverable

### 5. **External daic Command** 🟡
**Problem**: Switching modes requires external terminal
- Breaking flow to run `daic` command
- Not discoverable within Claude Code
- Feels disconnected from main workflow

## Improvement Proposals

### Phase 1: Quick Install & Better Onboarding

#### 1.1 Quick Install Mode
**Goal**: Get users started in 30 seconds

**Implementation**:
```python
# Add to install.py
def quick_install(self):
    """Quick installation with smart defaults"""
    print("🚀 Quick Install Mode - Smart defaults, configure later")

    # Smart defaults
    self.config.update({
        "developer_name": get_git_name() or "developer",
        "trigger_phrases": ["make it so", "go ahead", "ship it"],
        "api_mode": False,  # Enable ultrathink by default
        "statusline_installed": False  # Can enable later
    })

    # Skip all prompts, install with defaults
    self.create_directories()
    self.copy_files()
    self.install_memory_bank_mcp()  # Still try MCP setup
    self.save_config()
    self.setup_claude_md()

    print("✅ Ready in 30 seconds! Run '/tutorial' to learn the workflow")
```

**Command Line**:
```bash
cc-sessions --quick     # Quick install
cc-sessions --default   # Alias for quick
cc-sessions             # Regular install (current behavior)
```

#### 1.2 Tutorial System
**Goal**: Interactive 3-minute walkthrough

**Implementation**: Create `.claude/commands/tutorial.md`
```markdown
# Tutorial Command

**Description**: Interactive cc-sessions workflow tutorial

## Tutorial Flow:
1. Welcome message and overview
2. Create sample task ("tutorial-sample-fix")
3. Experience DAIC workflow with explanation
4. Show trigger phrase usage
5. Demonstrate an agent (context-gathering)
6. Complete task and show cleanup
7. Show available commands overview

## Implementation:
- Uses Task tool to create guided experience
- Creates temporary files for demonstration
- Cleans up after completion
- Tracks tutorial progress in .claude/state/tutorial.json
```

#### 1.3 Welcome Experience
**Goal**: Guide users on first launch

**Implementation**: Enhance `session-start.py`
```python
# Check for first-time user
if not (project_root / ".claude/state/onboarded.json").exists():
    show_welcome_message()
    create_onboarding_state()

def show_welcome_message():
    print("""
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║        🎉 Welcome to cc-sessions!              ║
║    Structured AI Pair Programming Workflow     ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Quick Start Guide:
1. Say: "Let's create a sample task"
2. I'll guide you through the DAIC workflow
3. Experience: Discussion → Alignment → Implementation → Check

Available at any time:
• /tutorial  - 3-minute interactive walkthrough
• /help      - Command reference
• /status    - Check current mode and task
• /configure - Adjust settings

The key insight: I'll discuss approaches before coding to prevent
going off-rails. Say one of your trigger phrases when ready to implement.
    """)
```

### Phase 2: Better Mode Feedback & Status

#### 2.1 Status Command
**Goal**: Clear visibility of current state

**Implementation**: Create `.claude/commands/status.md`
```markdown
# Status Command

Shows comprehensive current session state:

## Display Format:
```
╔══════════════════════════════════════╗
║             SESSION STATUS           ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════╝

🎯 Mode: Discussion (ready to plan)
📋 Task: fix-login-bug
🌳 Branch: fix/login-bug
🔧 Triggers: "make it so", "go ahead", "ship it"
📊 Context: 96k/200k tokens (48%)
💾 Memory Bank: ✅ Connected (7 files synced)

Commands Available:
• /daic        - Switch to implementation mode
• /tutorial    - Interactive workflow guide
• /help        - Full command reference
• /configure   - Adjust settings

Next: Describe your approach, then say a trigger phrase to implement.
```
```

#### 2.2 Enhanced Mode Feedback
**Goal**: Always-clear mode indication

**Implementation**: Update mode display in hooks
```python
# In sessions-enforce.py
def show_mode_banner():
    mode = get_current_mode()
    if mode == "discussion":
        print("""
╔══════════════════════════════════════╗
║ 🔴 DISCUSSION MODE - Let's plan first ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════╝
        """)
    elif mode == "implementation":
        print("""
╔════════════════════════════════════════╗
║ 🟢 IMPLEMENTATION MODE - Ready to code ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════╝
        """)
```

#### 2.3 Internal /daic Command
**Goal**: Mode switching within Claude Code

**Implementation**: Create `.claude/commands/daic.md`
```markdown
# DAIC Mode Toggle Command

**Description**: Switch between Discussion and Implementation modes

## Usage:
- `/daic` - Toggle to opposite mode
- `/daic discussion` - Force discussion mode
- `/daic implementation` - Force implementation mode

## Implementation:
Updates .claude/state/daic-mode.json directly
Shows clear feedback about mode change
```

### Phase 3: Enhanced Help & Discoverability

#### 3.1 Contextual Help System
**Goal**: Help users discover features progressively

**Implementation**: Create comprehensive help commands
```markdown
# Help Commands Structure

/help              - Main help overview
/help workflow     - DAIC workflow explanation
/help agents       - Available agents and usage
/help commands     - All slash commands
/help memory       - Memory Bank integration
/help tasks        - Task management
/help config       - Configuration options
```

#### 3.2 Feature Discovery Prompts
**Goal**: Surface hidden capabilities contextually

**Implementation**: Add discovery hints in workflow
```python
# After user completes first task
if is_first_task_completion():
    print("""
🎉 Great job completing your first task!

💡 Pro tip: Did you know about these powerful features?
• Agents: Use "context-gathering agent" for deep code analysis
• Memory Bank: Your insights persist across sessions
• Build Projects: Use /build-project for multi-phase work

Want to learn more? Try /help agents or /tutorial advanced
    """)
```

#### 3.3 Smart Suggestions
**Goal**: Contextual feature recommendations

**Implementation**: Add workflow intelligence
```python
# After multiple file edits
if edited_files_count > 3:
    suggest("💡 Consider using the code-review agent before committing")

# After working on same codebase multiple sessions
if return_user and not memory_bank_setup:
    suggest("💡 Memory Bank can preserve your insights across sessions")

# During complex task
if task_complexity_high:
    suggest("💡 Try /build-project for structured multi-step planning")
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Fork-First Development Approach

**Philosophy**: Build and validate in our fork before contributing upstream

**Benefits**:
- **Fast iteration** without waiting for consensus
- **Proof of concept** with real users
- **Risk mitigation** - test thoroughly before PR submission
- **Flexibility** - keep fork-specific features that upstream may not want

### Feature Bundling Strategy

**Critical Insight**: Quick Install + Tutorial = **One Cohesive Onboarding Package**

**Why they must ship together**:
- Quick install creates knowledge gap → Tutorial fills it
- Tutorial assumes minimal setup → Quick install provides it
- Both target same user (new to cc-sessions)
- Success metric is time-to-first-productive-task

**Revised PR Groupings**:
1. **Complete Onboarding Package** (Phase 1)
2. **Enhanced Feedback System** (Phase 2)
3. **Discovery & Advanced Features** (Phase 3)

## Implementation Phases & Branch Strategy

- Reduced support questions about available features

## Branch Naming Conventions

### Our Fork Branches:
```
feature/onboarding-overhaul     # Phase 1: Complete onboarding
feature/enhanced-feedback       # Phase 2: Better UX feedback
feature/discovery-system        # Phase 3: Feature discovery
hotfix/windows-encoding-fix     # Already merged
docs/improvement-plan           # This planning document
```

### Development Workflow:
1. **Create feature branch** from main
2. **Implement complete phase** in branch
3. **Test thoroughly** with real scenarios
4. **Gather user feedback** if possible
5. **Submit PR to upstream** when validated
6. **Keep fork branch** for ongoing iteration

## PR Submission Strategy

### Timing & Approach:

**Phase 1 PR**: Submit after 2-3 weeks of fork validation
- Complete working onboarding system
- Screenshots/demos of tutorial flow
- User feedback and metrics
- "We solved the onboarding problem completely"

**Phase 2 PR**: Submit 2-4 weeks after Phase 1 acceptance
- Builds on successful onboarding foundation
- Addresses next biggest user pain point
- Data from Phase 1 users to support need

**Phase 3 PR**: Submit when upstream signals interest
- Most advanced/opinionated features
- May keep some fork-exclusive
- Focus on proven value adds

### PR Descriptions Template:
```markdown
## Problem
[Clear pain point with evidence]

## Solution
[Complete working solution]

## Validation
[User feedback, metrics, testing done in fork]

## Implementation
[Technical details, backwards compatibility]

## Next Steps
[How this sets up future improvements]
```

## Risk Mitigation & Fallback

### If Upstream Rejects PR:
- **Keep in fork** as value-add differentiation
- **Market fork** as "cc-sessions Enhanced"
- **Continue iteration** based on fork user feedback
- **Resubmit later** with more evidence/refinement

### Backwards Compatibility:
- All features are **additive only**
- Existing installations work unchanged
- New features can be **disabled** via config
- Migration paths for any config changes

### Performance Impact:
- Tutorial system uses **separate context** (no impact)
- Status commands are **read-only** and fast
- Discovery hints are **lightweight** checks
- No changes to core DAIC performance
