# Proposed TL;DR Addition for Upstream README

This is a minimal addition we could propose to the original GWUDCAP/cc-sessions repository to address issue #42 (README is too verbose and hard to understand).

---

## Suggested Addition (Right after the ASCII art header):

```markdown
## TL;DR - What Is This?

**CC-Sessions** = Claude Code + Guardrails

**The Problem:** Claude Code rewrites your entire codebase when you ask it to add a button.

**The Solution:** CC-Sessions forces Claude to discuss changes before implementing them.

**How it works:**
1. Claude explains what it wants to do
2. You say "make it so" (or your custom phrase)
3. Only then can Claude edit files
4. Say "STOP" to lock it down again

**Install:** `pipx install cc-sessions` → Restart Claude Code → Done

**What changes:** Claude can't edit without permission. No more surprise refactors.

## Why This Works

1. **Addresses issue #42 directly** - Provides immediate understanding
2. **Non-invasive** - Just adds a section, doesn't change existing content
3. **Preserves original style** - Keeps the entertaining rant in collapsible section
4. **Gives users choice** - Quick understanding OR full context

## Alternative Minimal Version

If they prefer even more minimal:

```markdown
## What is CC-Sessions?

**In one sentence:** Makes Claude Code ask permission before editing your files.

- **Before:** Claude immediately rewrites half your codebase
- **After:** Claude explains the plan, you approve, then it edits
- **Install:** `pipx install cc-sessions` (5 minutes)
```

This proposal:
- Solves the "too much text" problem
- Maintains compatibility with existing README
- Can be easily merged without disrupting documentation
