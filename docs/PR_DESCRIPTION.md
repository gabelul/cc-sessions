# PR: Add TL;DR Section to README (Addresses Issue #42)

## Summary

Adds a concise TL;DR section to the README to address issue #42 where users found the README "too verbose" and couldn't understand the core meaning.

## Changes

- **NEW**: TL;DR section explaining cc-sessions in simple terms
- **IMPROVED**: Original content moved to collapsible details section
- **MAINTAINED**: All existing content preserved, just reorganized

## Why This Fixes Issue #42

The original issue stated: *"There is too much text in the README, can't understand the core :("*

This PR provides immediate clarity while preserving the detailed explanation for those who want it.

**Before:**
- Users hit a wall of text and complex explanations
- Core concept buried in lengthy introduction
- No quick way to understand what cc-sessions actually does

**After:**
- Clear one-sentence explanation at the top
- Simple before/after comparison
- Quick install instructions
- Full details available in expandable section

## Implementation Details

```markdown
## TL;DR - What Is This?

**CC-Sessions** = Claude Code + Guardrails

**The Problem:** Claude Code rewrites your entire codebase when you ask it to add a button.

**The Solution:** CC-Sessions forces Claude to discuss changes before implementing them.

**How it works:**
1. Claude explains what it wants to do
2. You say "make it so" (or your custom phrase)
3. Only then can Claude edit files
4. Say "STOP" to lock it down again

**Install:** `pipx install cc-sessions` → Restart Claude Code → Done

**What changes:** Claude can't edit without permission. No more surprise refactors.
