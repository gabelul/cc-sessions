# CC-Sessions Documentation

**Welcome to the "Claude, please stop refactoring my entire codebase" documentation.**

## Just Started? Read This First

If you just installed this because Claude was being annoying, here's what you need to know:

- **[Your first 10 minutes](quickstart.md)** - What's actually happening and how to use it
- **[Common scenarios](examples.md)** - Real stuff you'll run into (and how to fix it)

## Daily Driving CC-Sessions

Once you get it, here's the stuff that makes life easier:

- **[All the commands](commands.md)** - The full list of what you can do
- **[Configuration](config.md)** - Make it work your way
- **[When stuff breaks](troubleshooting.md)** - Because it will, and that's okay

## Going Deep

For when you want to understand the magic (or build your own):

- **[How the hooks work](advanced.md)** - The actual enforcement mechanism
- **[Writing agents](agents.md)** - Delegate the heavy lifting to specialized subagents
- **[Architecture](architecture.md)** - Why it works this way (spoiler: because Claude has ADHD)

## Wait, What Is This Thing Again?

CC-Sessions makes Claude ask permission before editing your code. That's it.

No more "I asked for a button and got a complete TypeScript migration." Claude explains what it wants to do first. You approve. Then it does JUST that.

## The Original Rant

If you want to read the hilarious but confusing original explanation that brought you here, it's preserved in **[the-rant.md](the-rant.md)**.
