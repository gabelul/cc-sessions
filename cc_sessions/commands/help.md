# Help - cc-sessions Overview

Welcome to **cc-sessions** - because productive AI pair programming shouldn't feel like navigating a maze in the dark.

## Quick Start Guide

### The Basics (DAIC Workflow)
1. **Discussion mode** (ðŸ”´) - Chat, plan, explain (you start here)
2. **Implementation mode** (ðŸŸ¢) - Code gets written
3. Switch modes with trigger phrases: "make it so", "go ahead", "ship it"

### Essential Commands
- `/status` - See what's happening right now
- `/tutorial` - Interactive walkthrough (3 minutes)
- `/help workflow` - Deep dive into DAIC methodology

## Feature Discovery Path

### Just Starting? ðŸŒ±
- Try `/tutorial` for hands-on learning
- Use `/status` when you're lost
- Practice trigger phrases to switch between discussion and coding

### Getting Comfortable? ðŸ”§
- Learn about specialized agents: `/help agents`
- Set up Memory Bank for persistent context: `/help memory`
- Organize complex work: `/help tasks`

### Ready for Advanced Features? ðŸš€
- Multi-phase projects: `/help commands` (look for /build-project)
- Custom configurations: `/add-trigger` for personalized workflow
- Troubleshooting: `/help troubleshoot`

## Core Philosophy

**cc-sessions enforces Discussion-Alignment-Implementation-Check (DAIC)**:
- No surprise code changes
- Explicit approval before implementation
- Context preservation across sessions
- Specialized agents for heavy lifting

Think of it as adding structure to AI pair programming - you stay in control, AI handles the heavy lifting.
